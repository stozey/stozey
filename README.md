- 👋 Hi, I’m @stozey
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a front-end developer at a major company.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to start a full-stack project and complete both the front and back end of it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project I can get my hands on, I think any experience at all is good experience.
- 📫 To reach me discord @ .stozey is the best way.
